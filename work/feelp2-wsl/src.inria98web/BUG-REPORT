   FILE:  mesh_bamg_exec/make_boundary_data_bamg.c
   FUNC:  add_corner_name_bamg()

   BUGS:  In current temporary support for bamg mesh, the uniq procedure
          for Dirichlet boundary data functionality is omitted.

          which works, 
            dbc:  ....., on a,ab;   
          originally, the node data a is not duplicated.....

2) DATE:  1997/11/14
   FILE:  geom2d/get_polygon_area.c

   BUGS:  If the polygonal shape is concave, there a lot of errors in the 
          original algorithm.  Most of them are thought to be eliminated,
          but, ultimate certification has not been done yet.

3) DATE:  1998/10/02
   FILE:  get_region_area.c

   BUGS:  It seems if there exist more than 2 holes, there will be bug
          It seems there something wrong with MAX_POINTS

   SOLU:  06/oct/98  in ReverseIntArray.c, function name was wrong.
          Le nom de fonction est mal a la fichier de ReverseIntArray.c

   BUGS:  segmentation fault
  
   SOLU:                           n                              n
    for(i=0;i<n;i++) {
        if(streq(var_name,name_ptr[i][0]) && streq(name, name_ptr[i][1])) {
            return;
        }
    }

   Wow !!!!!!!!!
