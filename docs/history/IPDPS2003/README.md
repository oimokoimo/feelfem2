## IPDPS 2003 Presentation

This directory contains the original presentation slides
presented at IPDPS 2003 by Hidehiro Fujio (NEC Corporation).

The presentation describes:
- FEM code generation as a knowledge-based PSE
- Separation of algorithms and implementations by pseudo-code
- Repository-oriented reuse of numerical algorithms
- DSL-style variational formulation for FEM problems

These ideas form the conceptual foundation of feelfem2.
