This includes:

- original `lex` and `yacc` grammar files
- historical source codes
- documents related to IPDPS 2003 and earlier publications

These files represent **a fully operational historical FEM DSL system** and are kept as:

> ✅ a technical archive  
> ✅ a reproducible research artifact  
> ✅ a conceptual reference for feelfem2

## 5. feelfem2 Development Goals

- ✅ modern DSL parser
- ✅ 2D FEM first, 3D extensible
- ✅ bamg-compatible mesh input
- ✅ GiD-compatible 3D workflow
- ✅ discontinuous elements (ewise variables)
- ✅ weak-form + boundary-integral hybrid notation
- ✅ clean Fortran 90/2003 reference backend
- ✅ GPU-ready future backend
- ✅ direct computation of H¹ norms and energy norms

## 6. Current Status

- Repository initialized
- DSL prototype (`feelfem.pde`) committed
- Legacy grammar preserved
- Design document under preparation

This project is currently in **conceptual + parser design phase**.

## 7. Author

- **Hidehiro Fujio**
- Former NEC researcher (Parallel FEM, DSL, PSE)
- Currently working in scientific computing infrastructure and security

---

## 8. License

This project is intended to be released as **free academic software**.  
Exact license will be determined after the initial prototype release.

---

## 9. Vision

If successful, **feelfem2 will become:**

> A textbook-quality FEM code generator  
> A research-grade FEM DSL  
> A fully open educational FEM environment  

developed collaboratively between **human mathematical intuition** and **modern LLM-assisted software engineering**.
